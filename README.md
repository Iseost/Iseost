# Hi there 👋

![image](banner.jpg)

I'm Iselin — a 34 years young, creative frontend developer who one day stumbled upon a new and exciting way of creating things: coding.

I’m (hopefully!) about to graduate from Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media as a Frontend Developer. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and visually appealing web solutions.

I love transforming ideas and designs into functional, user-friendly experiences through code. My goal is to continue growing as a developer, but right now, I’m most excited to bring my newly gained skills into the real world and start contributing to meaningful projects!

## Fun facts 🫶

- 🍰 I like to bake

- ☕ It's not a good idea to talk to me before my morning coffee
